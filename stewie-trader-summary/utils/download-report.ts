Main Street registered investment advisors RIAs and small-to-mid-sized hedge funds as
primary customer segments for an AI-powered trading platform. As these segments navigate an
increasingly complex financial landscape, they represent strategic growth opportunities for
sophisticated trading technology solutions.
The RIA space is evolving rapidly in 2025, creating both challenges and opportunities for Main
Street advisors. According to industry analyses, RIAs are facing shifting client expectations,
increased regulatory complexities, and unprecedented technological advancements. The
competitive environment is intensifying as larger firms with substantial resources continue to
acquire smaller practices, as evidenced by OneDigital's expansion which added approximately
$6.5 billion in assets through acquisitions of wealth management firms.
Main Street RIAs operate in a highly fragmented market where differentiation and efficiency are
critical success factors. These advisors must navigate a bewildering array of technology options,
with industry experts noting that advisors attending large conferences may encounter "over 100
different technology vendors" offering solutions for their practice. This technology overload
presents both an opportunity and a challenge for new AI-powered trading platforms seeking to
penetrate this market.
Main Street RIAs struggle with selecting and integrating the right technologies from an
overwhelming number of options. They need comprehensive solutions that can streamline
operations and enhance client service without requiring extensive technical expertise. Many
are seeking ways to simplify their technology stack while still accessing sophisticated
capabilities that can help them compete with larger firms.

Smaller and mid-sized RIAs face significant competitive pressure from larger wealth
management firms that have greater resources to invest in advanced technologies and
marketing. With industry consolidation continuing through 2025, as shown by OneDigital's
acquisition strategy, smaller RIAs need access to institutional-quality tools that allow them to
maintain independence while offering competitive services.
A critical challenge for RIAs in 2025 is integrating AI technology while maintaining the human
touch that clients value. Industry forecasts predict that "assets managed by algorithm-driven
and increasingly AI-enabled digital platforms will surge to almost US$6 trillion in the next 2
years," indicating a significant trend toward AI adoption in wealth management. However,
RIAs must balance technological efficiency with the personal relationships that differentiate them
from fully automated solutions.
Main Street RIAs need technology that helps them differentiate their services in a crowded
marketplace. AI-powered trading platforms that provide unique insights, customizable reporting,
and client-friendly visualizations can help advisors demonstrate their value proposition more
effectively. Technology that improves the clarity of messaging and enhances digital presence
aligns with modern RIA marketing requirements.
With compressed margins and rising costs, RIAs need technology that streamlines back-office
operations. AI solutions that automate routine tasks, reduce redundancies, and enhance
compliance processes allow advisors to focus more time on high-value client interactions.
Cloud-based platforms that require minimal infrastructure investment are particularly appealing
to cost-conscious RIAs.
To compete effectively, Main Street RIAs need access to the same quality of market intelligence
that larger firms utilize. AI-powered platforms that provide sophisticated market analysis,
identify emerging trends, and generate actionable insights can help level the playing field for
smaller advisory firms. These capabilities have become increasingly important as investment
advisors are expected to demonstrate proficiency with digital tools and platforms that enable
more efficient portfolio management.

Small-to-mid-sized hedge funds face distinct challenges in the 2025 market environment. They
must compete with larger firms that have substantial resources to implement advanced
technologies while navigating an increasingly complex regulatory landscape. The collective
assets under management in the hedge fund industry exceed $5 trillion in the United States,
making it a significant market opportunity despite its challenges.
The regulatory environment for AI use in trading decisions is evolving rapidly but remains
insufficient according to Senate committee findings. A 45-page report from the Senate
Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee warned that federal financial regulators
are "playing catch-up in their oversight of how hedge funds are using artificial intelligence to
guide trading decisions," presenting both compliance challenges and opportunities for platforms
that can address these concerns.
Small-to-mid-sized hedge funds face a significant challenge: they must compete with larger
firms while operating with more limited resources. They "must grapple with advanced AI-driven
analytics, machine learning algorithms for risk management, and the increasing need for real-
time data aggregation across global markets" despite having smaller technology budgets and
teams. This creates a need for cost-effective solutions that deliver institutional-quality
capabilities.
The regulatory landscape for AI use in trading decisions is increasingly complex and evolving
rapidly. The Senate report found that "the risks of future impacts resulting from AI use in
investment decisions go beyond potential harm to individual investors and could have an impact
on wider financial stability". This creates an urgent need for compliance-focused technology
solutions that can help funds navigate regulatory requirements while still leveraging AI
advantages.
Facing compressed margins and rising operational costs, small-to-mid-sized hedge funds must
prioritize efficiency. They need "modular and cloud-based solutions to streamline operations,
reduce redundancies, and remain competitive without inflating expenses". Technologies that
can deliver sophisticated capabilities without requiring significant infrastructure investment or
specialized staff are particularly valuable to this segment.

Small-to-mid-sized hedge funds need access to sophisticated AI trading capabilities that don't
require massive infrastructure investments or specialized data science teams. Platforms that
provide pre-built algorithms, customizable strategies, and institutional-grade execution
capabilities allow these funds to compete more effectively with larger rivals. Cloud-based
solutions that scale with the fund's needs offer particular advantages.
With increasing market volatility and regulatory scrutiny, robust risk management capabilities are
essential for hedge funds of all sizes. AI-powered platforms that can identify potential risks,
model various scenarios, and provide real-time risk metrics offer significant value to small-to-
mid-sized funds. These capabilities become even more valuable when they incorporate
compliance considerations that help funds navigate regulatory requirements.
As digital threats increase, cybersecurity has become a critical concern for hedge funds. The
need for "robust cybersecurity measures and compliance with new regulatory requirements are
critical to protecting sensitive data and maintaining investor trust". AI-powered trading
platforms that incorporate strong security features and compliance controls address a
significant pain point for small-to-mid-sized funds.
Marketing to Main Street RIAs should emphasize how AI-powered trading platforms enhance
rather than replace the advisor's expertise. Messaging should focus on how the technology
frees advisors to spend more time on client relationships while providing institutional-quality
insights. Clear, jargon-free communication is essential, as RIA marketing guidance emphasizes
the need to "avoid jargon" and not use "overly technical language".
Highlighting the platform's ability to help RIAs differentiate themselves in a competitive
marketplace will resonate with this segment. Marketing should demonstrate how the technology
enables advisors to articulate their value proposition more effectively to clients and
prospects. Case studies and testimonials that show how similar-sized firms have leveraged
the platform successfully can be particularly persuasive.

For small-to-mid-sized hedge funds, marketing should emphasize cost-effective access to
institutional-quality AI trading capabilities. Messaging should focus on how the platform enables
these funds to compete with larger rivals despite resource constraints. Demonstrating
specific performance advantages, risk management improvements, and operational efficiencies
will resonate with this segment.
Regulatory compliance capabilities should be prominently featured in marketing to hedge funds,
given the increasing scrutiny of AI use in trading decisions. Messaging should highlight how
the platform helps funds navigate complex regulatory requirements while still leveraging the
advantages of AI technology. Security features and data protection capabilities should also be
emphasized to address cybersecurity concerns.
A phased approach to targeting these segments is recommended:
Main Street RIAs and small-to-mid-sized hedge funds represent strategically valuable customer
segments for an AI-powered trading platform. Both segments face significant challenges in
competing with larger rivals and navigating an increasingly complex technological and
regulatory landscape. By addressing their specific needs for sophisticated yet accessible AI
trading capabilities, compliance support, operational efficiency, and competitive differentiation,
your platform can establish a strong market position before expanding to retail investors.
The market opportunity is substantial, with RIAs and hedge funds collectively managing trillions
in assets while struggling with technology integration challenges. By focusing initially on these
professional segments, your platform can build credibility, refine capabilities, and establish a
track record of success that will be valuable when expanding to retail investors in subsequent
phases.
